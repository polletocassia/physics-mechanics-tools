# ⚙️ PHYSICS MECHANICS TOOLS ⚙️   

<p>Physics Mechanics Tools is a web application developed in PHP that aims to facilitate the calculation and understanding of classic situations in the Physics of Motion. The system was designed for students who want to practically visualize the results of mechanical formulas applied to different scenarios, such as pulleys, blocks, inclined planes, and rotational systems.</p>
  <p>Each of the five physical situations addressed represents a classic theoretical model frequently studied in mechanics courses, allowing the calculation of variables such as acceleration, tension, frequency, force, and angular momentum. The system automatically performs the calculations from the values ​​entered by the user, displaying the results with appropriate numerical formatting and the formulas used.</p>
